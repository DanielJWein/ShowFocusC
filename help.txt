ShowFocusC 1.0 Help
7/20/2024

This program was originally written (judging by file dates in my zip archive) 
    on August 31, 2018, when I was only 16 years old. I had been frustrated
    with apps taking focus while I was playing games and decided to make an app
    that would log all of the programs that took focus.

This program was thrown into The Archive™️, which is essentially the "I don't need
    this program any more but I don't want to rewrite it if I ever need it again"
    folder in my backup system. It is precisely this reason that on July 20, 2024,
    at 8:30 AM, I have revisited this project - some window, probably Discord, is 
    stealing focus from VALORANT while I'm trying to play competitive games.

This short fifty-line program aims to determine the thieving program by recording
    the name of the current focused window twenty times a second (unless it did not 
    change). I think this should be fine, but if you need it to be faster, you can
    adjust SFC_SLEEP_INTERVAL.

Define Settings:
    SFC_MIN_LENGTH      The minimum length a window's title must be to be shown
    SFC_SLEEP_INTERVAL  The interval, in ms, to check for a new foreground window.
    SFC_ENABLE_LOCALE   Set to 1 to enable locale shenanigannery
    SFC_BUFFERLENGTH    The number of characters a window's title can be

Locale and Font Shenanigan Troubleshooting:
    If output is incorrect (mojibake or other), please run the program again with 
        your locale in the arguments (must be compiled with SFC_ENABLE_LOCALE = 1):
            ShowFocusC.exe JA-jp

    If characters are appearing as '?', check your console's font settings.

    In my experience, PowerShell seems to work best.

    It is entirely possible that changing the locale is not done correctly. I tried
        to implement it, but I don't actually have any other versions of Windows to 
        test on.
